\BackBody{This book focuses on the role size plays in grammar. Under the umbrella term \textit{size} fall the size of syntactic projections, the size of feature content, and the size of reference sets. This Volume II discusses size effects in movement, agreement, and interpretation while the contributions in Volume I focus on size and structure building.

Part I of Volume II investigates how size interacts with head movement and various phrasal movement including left branch extraction, object shift, tough movement, and multiple wh movement.
Part II of this volume discusses the role size plays in agreement and morphology-related matters like allomorphy. 
Contributions in Part III focus on semantic-oriented issues, in particular the size of reference domains and NPI licensing.

The languages covered in this volume include American Sign Language, Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian and various Slavic languages, German, Icelandic, dialects of Italian, Japanese, Nancowry, Panoan languages, and Tamil.}
